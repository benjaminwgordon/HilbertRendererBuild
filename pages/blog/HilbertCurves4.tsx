            Recursive Generation of Hilbert Curve Coordinates
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            Hilbert Curves were first described in 1891, as a close relative to
            the previously existing Peano curve. Since Hilbert Curves are
            fractal, the common way to generate them involves recursion. In
            fact, the algorithm I briefly described in Part 1 of this series is
            a recursive algorithm. Since the recursive algorithm is the most
            readily accessible one in most other online sources, I won't spend
            any further time discussing it here. I only mention it as context
            for the algorithm I will be describing, whose main differentiating
            factor is that it is iterative, not recursive.

            Hilbert Curves as a Transformation of Binary Reflected Gray Codes
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            The algorithm I set out to recreate was proposed by John Skilling in
            2003. It fundementally relies on Binary Reflected Gray Codes, which
            are fascinating and widely useful patterns. Essentially, they are an
            alternate counting system in Binary, that hold an important
            property: only one bit of the binary representation changes between
            any adjacent numbers. Below, I've posted a Rust Iterator I've
            written that generates Binary Reflected Gray Codes. (I know I said I
            wouldn't use bitwise operators in my code examples, but the
            generation of BRGC's isn't the core of this blog post.)
          </p>
          <DarkCodeBlock
            text={`#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Brgc {
    // callers will typically create the iterator with index = 0
    pub index: u32,
}

impl Iterator for Brgc {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let gray = self.index ^ (self.index >> 1);
        self.index += 1;
        Some(gray)
    }
}`}
            language={"rust"}
          />
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            Implenting BRGC's as an iterator is particularly useful for my
            purposes, because the amount of BRGC's necessary for generating a
            particular Hilbert Curve varies depending on the dimensions and
            order of the Hilbert Curve.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            Here is an example of the iterator being used to print the first 8
            BRGC codes:
          </p>
          <DarkCodeBlock
            text={`fn main() {
    let brgc = Brgc { index: 0 };
    brgc.take(8).for_each(|code| {
        println!("{:03b}", code);
    })
}

  // Results in the first 8 BRGC codes:
  000
  001
  011
  010
  110
  111
  101
  100
  `}
            language={"rust"}
          />
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            Note that in the above example, each binary number in the BRGC
            sequence differs by only one bit. This shares a strong similarity
            with one of the core attributes of a Hilbert Curve! In a Hilbert
            Curve, the vector between any two adjacent vertices will have length
            1, and will only differ in x, y, or z (exclusively). To state that
            more plainly, the lines in a Hilbert Curve are all horizontal or
            vertical, there are no diagonal lines. Starting with a BRGC as the
            basis for our algorithm gives us a head-start on creating that
            behavior in our resulting Hilbert Curves.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 ">
            This will become more clear once we work through another core
            principle of this algorithm: assigning bits of the gray codes to
            axes in a 2D or 3D vector.
          </p>

            It would be very nice if these happened to be the coordinates to the
            first 8 vertices of a Hilbert Curve, but there is a big problem with
            the data we've generated so far. Let's review a few rules we've set
            for a Hilbert Curve:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 ">
            For each pair of sequential vertices, the vector between them must
            follow these rules:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-8">
            <li>
              The vector should change in x, y, or z (exclusively). This makes
              the line vertical or horizontal.
            </li>
            <li>The vector should have length 1</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="pb-8">
            This mapping of the BRGC's to Vertices accomplishes goal #1 (each
            sequential pair only changes in x, y, or z), but fails goal #2. The
            length of the x component of the vector is more than 1 when we jump
            from 010000 to 110000, since the x component moves from 0 to 2.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-8">
            Even though the generated coordinates aren't quite right yet, this
            pattern of extracting the x, y, and z components a binary string
            will still be the first step in our final algorithm. Below is my
            Rust code that seperates out the (x,y,z) components from a u32.
            Since both 2D and 3D curves are of interest to me for rendering,
            there is a seperate function that supports breaking a u32 into 2D
            coordinates.

            Essentially, we want to walk through each bit of the brgc, starting
            at the lowest-order bit and walking left. For each bit, we check to
            see whether that bit is 0 or 1. Depending on that result, we perform
            one of two types of bit swapping operations. I'll call these two
            operations <span className="font-bold italic">exchange</span> and{" "}
            <span className="font-bold italic">invert</span>, and provide a
            visual explanation of each below.

            We will start with the inversion operation, as it is simpler.
